Create a new entity for “vendor”. Create a new table (training4_vendor, with two fields for vendor_id, name), and create a data install/upgrade script to connect vendors with products (training4_vendor2product, using many-to-many connections). 
On the product view page, show a block with a list of assigned vendors. (Bluecom_Vendor)
